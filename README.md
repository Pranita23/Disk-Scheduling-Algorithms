# Disk-Scheduling-Algorithms
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling.

Disk scheduling is important because:

Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be scheduled.
Two or more requests may be far from each other so can result in greater disk arm movement.
Hard drives are one of the slowest parts of the computer system and thus need to be accessed in an efficient manner.
		
The program offers a choice to the user to select between any three disk scheduling algorithms namely  FCFS (First Come First Serve), CLOOK (Circular LOOK) and CSCAN (Circular SCAN). The user can input the number of disk locations, the position of the head and subsequent disk locations and the output will be the Disk sequence, the total seek time and the average seek time. The user can compare and assess the outputs from the different algorithms that have been implemented and develop a deeper and better understanding of the same.
